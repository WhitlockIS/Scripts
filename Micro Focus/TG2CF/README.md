**TG2CF** is a python3 script that reads template groups and creates the same structure in the “Management Templates/Aspects” section of “Monitoring” in OBM/OMi. Additionally, the script will read the policies in the template groups and bundle them into an aspect and then copy that aspect into the related configuration folder.

This can be the most work for a legacy OM upgrade, and while Monitoring Automation dictates a new thought process around policy grouping, sometimes, one needs to forklift in the legacy structure and deploy “as-is”
