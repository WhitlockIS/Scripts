# Scripts and tools for managing the IT enterprise. 

All scripts are "as is" with no warranty or implied fitness for production use.  Your mileage may vary.  Gluten free and locally sourced code.  No animals were harmed in the writing of this code (bored maybe). 

If you use the code, a shout out would be cool.  Otherwise, have at it!
